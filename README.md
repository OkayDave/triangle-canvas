# Triangle Canvas

Upload an image to the `<canvas />` then iteratively recreate it. Translucent shapes are placed at random intervals across the canvas. When there's enough of them, the canvas will look a bit like the original image.

It's available to use [here](https://okaydave.github.io/triange-canvas).
